							<h2>My Dev Skills</h2>
							
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Full Stack</h3>
									<p>I learned Full Stack dev from UW Bootcamp, and USED that knowledge at TechReuse. I have much experince with Node. I have experince with the MERN Stack. Mongoo Express React Node. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code-branch"></span>
									<h3>CRUD Development</h3>
									<p>Much of the projects I have been apart have been CRUD Development. I have created my own API's to connect a back end to the front end. See project: "Good Shop" for example of my CRUD work <p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-sitemap"></span>
									<h3>React</h3>
									<p>I first learned React at UW. I learned class base React. On my own I learned Function base React. React is one of my favorite tools to use. Its flexablity can not be understated. I used many React libraries, but due to the insane amount of React libraries out there, I don't know them all. However I am a quick learner and I'm willing to learn any libraries needed</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Vue</h3>
									<p>I learned Vue on my own. Coming from React, Vue was not too hard to pick up. However,  there is always some hurdles while learning something new. My biggest was understanding how Pinia (Vue's State Management) worked. As it was a different from React's. However I over came that hurdle and now really enjoying Vue.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-file-code"></span>
									<h3>CSS and CSS Libraries</h3>
									<p>I admit, I hated CSS at first learning it. But over time I grew to Love it! It amazes me how many cool things one can do in CSS. From cool animations, to using it with JS to creating a smooth UX. I used a lot of Bootstrap, MUI, and Sass im my projects.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-laptop-code"></span>
									<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
									<p>One of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of front-end design. Making it fit on all platforms. I was taught from   my SECOND week of programing the importance and how to make a responsive website. I mainly use @media querries to create a smooth responsive design.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-folder-open"></span>
									<h3>Databases</h3>
									<p>Databases, one of the most important parts of both the front-end and back-end. I used both a SQL Database, and JSON Database. I first learned MySQL, than I learned MongoDB. I also know LocalStorage, Cookies, Session Storage, and indexedDB as well.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-address-book"></span>
									<h3>Working in a Team</h3>
									<p>Some say this may not count as a skill, I beg to differ! Working in a team can be hard, everyone has their own thoughts and opinions. I have worked in team settings createing Full Stack Websites. Using tools such as AzureDevOps, and Github to track and upload are work. And yes I ran into issues with some people in groups before, but I am able to solve those issues and work together.</p>
